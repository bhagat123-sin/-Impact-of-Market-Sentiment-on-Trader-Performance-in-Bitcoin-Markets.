# -Impact-of-Market-Sentiment-on-Trader-Performance-in-Bitcoin-Markets.
Excited to share my latest Data Science project where I analyzed the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear &amp; Greed Index) and real trader performance data from Hyperliquid.
I recently completed a project where I explored how market emotions (Fear & Greed Index) affect real trader performance in the crypto market using historical trading data.

📊 In this project, I:
• Analyzed trader PnL across different market sentiments
• Compared performance during Fear vs Greed phases
• Studied trader behavior at both trade level and account level
• Looked for hidden patterns in losses, volatility, and consistency
• Used simple statistical checks to support the insights

🛠 Tools I used:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, EDA, Data Analysis
